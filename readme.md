This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). You can visit document [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/). Here you'll find out How to modify it.

### First - The Configuration

You see the file `_config.yml` right? Open it, and you'll see this line
```

```
You can change them in your own profile/username by changing after colon `:` syntax.

Oh, and this line: `google_analytics: UA-107485569-9`. If you have Google Analytics tracking ID, change it!

### Second - Profile

Change it to your own picture! This will display on HEADER. By changing it, this file located in `assets/images/` directory, the file `profile.jpg`. Don't change the file name unless you know how to do. The recommended resolution is `640x640` pixels.
